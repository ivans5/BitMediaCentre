TVision 0.8 - C++ application framework library
-----------------------------------------------

Turbo Vision (or TV, for short) is a library that provides an application
framework.  With TV you can write a beautiful object-oriented character-mode
user interface in a short time.

TV is available in C++ and Pascal and is a product of Borland International.
It was developed to run on MS-DOS systems, but today it is available for many
other platforms (ported by independent programmers).

This port is based on the Borland 2.0 version with fixes.

Warning: the BSD-style copyright is applicable only to the modifications
brought by Sergio Sigala to the original code.

Happy hacking!
