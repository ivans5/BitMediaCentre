  Date: Wed, 18 Jun 1997 07:32:15 +0300 (EET DST)

- Big changes in system.cc.  Now all the code uses only high level ncurses
  functions.  The drawback of this is that the video output is slower than
  the previous version.

- Fixed some code to make TV run under Linux for the PowerPC and other big
  endian architectures.  It runs fine, but maybe some other changes are
  required.

>>>>>>>> Changes from version 0.5 to 0.6 <<<<<<<<

- A real configure script.

- TVLOG environment variable introduced.  Log informations are written in the
  file specified by the TVLOG variable.  If the variable is not set, no log
  informations are produced.  Log informations will never be written on the
  screen.

- Dmitrij Korovkin <tkf@glasnet.ru> added the following changes:
  - TEditor and TFileEditor classes are modified to support files
    larger than 64kB
  - better signal handling
  - improved cyrillic character set support
  - mouse support in xterm

- Harald Hoyer <HarryH@Royal.Net> added the following:
  - mouse support in xterm
  - some changes is system.cc

- Pedro F. Giffuni <giffunip@asme.org> helped to fix a problem in
  `configure.in' under FreeBSD.

>>>>>>>> Changes from version 0.6 to 0.7 <<<<<<<<

- Vitaly Fedrushkov <willy@snowyowl.csu.ac.ru> added the following changes:
  - fixed a bug in system.cc about function has_colors()
  - changed some things in TMenuView.cc that prevent building with egcs-1.0.3
  - fixed configure.in

- Fixed some cursor things in system.cc.  Nice exit when the user teminates
  the program with Ctrl-C.

- Cosmetic changes and general cleaning in the code.  Now the library should
  compile without warnings, even using flags `-W -Wall'.  If you want to try
  just type:

  CXXFLAGS='-W -Wall' ./configure

  followed by `make'.

- More documentation included.  I used KDOC, a program distributed with KDE.
  KDOC uses specially-formatted documentation embedded in C++ class
  declarations to generate documentation for the classes.  Warning: this work
  is not finished yet.  Only the main classes are documented.

- Changes to fix warnings with egcs-1.1

- John Polstra <jdp@polstra.com> fixed a problem with gcc under FreeBSD

  and improved signal handling.

  buffer overflow problem in asm.cc.
