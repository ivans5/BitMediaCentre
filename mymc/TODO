Known bugs and things to do
---------------------------
- Fix textview.cc, textview.h and TTerminal::prevLines() in `asm.cc'.

- Applications will crash if you write more than 1024 characters in a single
  row in a TEditor object.  Search for maxLineLength in `TEditor.cc' to see
  why this happens.

- Apparently, we can't hide the cursor when the virtual console system
  output mechanism is used. Javor Dimitrov <logix@dobrich-sat.net>
  suggested to use ctermid(3) to get the controlling terminal name and then,
  if it's something like /dev/tty*, we could safely use the following escape
  sequences:

  ESC [ ? 25 l		To hide the cursor
  ESC [ ? 25 h		To show the cursor

  to do the job.  Take a look on console_codes(4) also.

- The use of the SIGALARM signal can conflict with other programs, any
  efficient alternative way would be better.

- Javor Dimitrov <java@dobrich-sat.net> reported that TFileEditor does not
  correctly restore original file attributes after saving files.

- "DOS shell" and "Alt-F3" menu items in the demo program are misleading:
  under Linux the first one doesn't have sense and the second switches to
  the third system console.

- Javor Dimitrov <java@dobrich-sat.net> gots a problem when he tried to
  detect errors on fpstream. Borland provides some documentation at:

  http://community.borland.com/article/0,1410,16134,00.html

  but it would not work he thinks, because the lines

  S = new fpstream(FileName, ios::out|ios::in|ios::binary);
  if (!S)
  {
    cout << "Error opening stream\n";
    exit(1);
  }

  can detect an memory allocation error, but not file open error.

- `make dist' gives problems with the recursive link `lib/tvision' when
  compressing.
